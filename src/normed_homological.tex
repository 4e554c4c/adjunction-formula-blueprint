\section{Some normed homological algebra}%
\label{sec:some_normed_homological_algebra}

\begin{definition}
  \label{system_of_complexes}
  \lean{system_of_complexes}
  \leanok
  A \emph{system of complexes} of normed abelian groups
  is for each sufficiently large $c$ (i.e.~all $c\geq c_0$ for some $c_0>0$),
  a complex
  \[
  C_c^\bullet: C_c^0\to C_c^1\to\ldots
  \]
  of normed abelian groups together with maps of complexes
  $\mathrm{res}_{c',c}: C_{c'}^\bullet\to C_c^\bullet$,
  for $c' ≥ c \geq c_0$,
  satisfying $\mathrm{res}_{c,c}=\mathrm{id}$ and the obvious associativity condition.
  We use notation $(C_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$ for a system of complexes,
  although we will frequently omit any mention of the lower bound $c_0$
  and just write $C_\bullet^\bullet$.
\end{definition}

By convention, for every system of complexes $(C_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$,
we will set $C^{-1}_c = 0$ for all $c\geq c_0$.
This will come up each time we write $C^{i-1}_c$ and $i$ could be $0$.

In this section, given $x ∈ C^•_{c'}$ and $c_0\leq c ≤ c'$ we will use the notation
$x_{|c} := \mathrm{res}_{c', c}(x)$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{admissible}
  \lean{system_of_complexes.admissible}
  \leanok
  \uses{system_of_complexes}
  A system of complexes is \emph{admissible}
  if all differentials and maps $\mathrm{res}_{c',c}^i$ are norm-nonincreasing.
\end{definition}

Throughout the rest of this section, $k$ (and $k'$, $k''$) will denote reals at least 1,
$m$ will be a non-negative integer, and $K$, $K'$, $K''$ will denote non-negative reals.

\begin{definition}
  \label{is_bounded_exact}
  \lean{system_of_complexes.is_bounded_exact}
  \leanok
  \uses{system_of_complexes}
  Let $(C_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$ be a system of complexes.
  For an integer $m\geq 0$ and reals $k \ge 1$, $c_0'\geq c_0$ and $K\geq0$,
  we say the datum $(C_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$ is
  \emph{$\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ and for $c\geq c_0'$ with bound $K$} if the following condition is satisfied.
  For all $c\geq c_0'$ and all $x\in C_{kc}^i$ with $i\leq m$
  there is some $y\in C_c^{i-1}$ such that
  \[
    ‖x_{|c} - dy‖ ≤ K ‖dx‖.
  \]
\end{definition}

We will also need a version where the inequality is relaxed by some arbitrary small additive constant.

\begin{definition}
  \label{is_weak_bounded_exact}
  \lean{system_of_complexes.is_weak_bounded_exact}
  \leanok
  \uses{system_of_complexes}
  Let $(C_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$ be a system of complexes.
  For an integer $m\geq 0$ and reals $k \ge 1$, $c_0'\geq c_0$ and $K\geq0$,
  the datum $(C_c^\bullet)_c$ is
  \emph{weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ and for $c\geq c_0'$ with bound $K$} if the following condition is satisfied.
  For all $c\geq c_0'$, all $x\in C_{kc}^i$ with $i\leq m$ and any $ε > 0$
  there is some $y\in C_c^{i-1}$ such that
  \[
    ‖x_{|c} - dy‖ ≤ K ‖dx‖ + ε.
  \]
\end{definition}

We first note that the difference between those two definitions is only about cocyles if we are ready to lose
a tiny something on the norm bound $K$. 



\begin{lemma}
  \label{is_bounded_exact_of_weakly}
  \lean{system_of_complexes.is_weak_bounded_exact.to_exact}
  \uses{is_bounded_exact, is_weak_bounded_exact}
  Let $C_\bullet^\bullet$ be a system of complexes. If $C_\bullet^\bullet$ is
  weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ and for $c\geq c_0'$ with bound $K$ and if,
  for all $c\geq c_0'$ and all $x\in C_{kc}^i$ with $i\leq m$ such that $dx = 0$
  there is some $y\in C_c^{i-1}$  such that
  $x_{|c} = dy$ then, for every positive $δ$,
  $C_\bullet^\bullet$ is $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ and for $c\geq c_0'$ with
  bound $K + δ$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $δ$ be some positive real number.
  Let $x$ be an element of $C_{kc}^i$ for some $c ≥ c_0'$ and $i ≤ m$. If $dx = 0$
  then the assumption we made about exact elements is exactly what we want.

  Assume now that $dx ≠ 0$. The weak exactness assumption applied to $ε = δ‖dx‖$
  gives some $y\in C_c^{i-1}$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    ‖x_{|c} - dy‖ &≤ K‖dx‖ + δ‖dx‖ \\
                  &= (K + δ)‖dx‖
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

A more important observation is that, in both definitions, we can also ask some
control on the norm of $y$ if we are ready to square the restriction depth factor $k$.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{is_weak_bdd_exact_controlled_y}
  \uses{is_weak_bounded_exact}
  % This statement exists in some comment somewhere
  % \lean{system_of_complexes.is_weak_bounded_exact.controlled_y}
  Let $C_\bullet^\bullet$ be a system of complexes which is
  weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ and for $c\geq c_0'$ with bound $K$.
  For all $c\geq c_0'$, all $x\in C_{k²c}^i$ with $i\leq m$, all $ε > 0$ and all $δ > 0$
  there is some $y\in C_c^{i-1}$ such that
  \[
    ‖x_{|c} - dy‖ ≤  K ‖dx‖ + ε
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    ‖y‖ ≤ K(K + 1)‖x‖ + δ.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Fix $x$, $ε$ and $δ$. The weak exactness assumption applied to $x$ and some $η$ to be chosen later gives us
  $w ∈ C_{kc}^{i-1}$ such that
  \[
    ‖x_{|kc} - dw‖ ≤  K ‖dx‖ + η.
  \]
  Then the weak exactness assumption applied to $w$ and some $τ$ to be chosen later gives us
  $z ∈ C_{c}^{i-2}$ such that
  \[
    ‖w_{|c} - dz‖ ≤  K ‖dw‖ + τ.
  \]
  We set $y = w_{|c} - dz$. Since $dy = dw_{|c}$, we get the first required estimate as long
  as $η ≤ ε$. And we have:
  \begin{align*}
    ‖y‖ &≤ K ‖dw‖ + τ \\
        &≤ K (‖x_{|kc}‖ + K‖dx‖ + η) + τ \\
        &≤ K(K + 1) ‖x‖ + Kη + τ
  \end{align*}
  which is fine as long as $Kη + τ ≤ δ$.
  So we set $η = \min(ε, δ/(2K))$ (interpreted as $ε$ if $K=0$) and $τ = δ/2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{completion_is_weakexact}
  \uses{is_weak_bounded_exact, admissible}
  % This statement exists in some comment somewhere
  % \lean{system_of_complexes.is_weak_bounded_exact.completion}
  Let $(M_c^\bullet)_{c\geq c_0}$ be an admissible collection
  of complexes of normed abelian groups.

  Assume that $M^\bullet_c$ is weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$.
  Then the completion $\overline{M^\bullet_c}$ is weakly $\leq k^2$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{is_weak_bdd_exact_controlled_y}
Let $x \in \overline{M^i_{k^2c}}$, where $c \geq c_0$ and $i \leq m$ and let $\epsilon > 0$.
We can write $x = \sum_j x^j$ where
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x^j \in M^i_{k^2c}$ for all $j \geq 0$,
 \item $‖x - x^0‖ ≤ ε_0$ for some positive $ε_0$ to be chosen later. This implies that $‖dx - dx^0‖ ≤ ε_0$ and
   in particular $‖dx^0‖ ≤ ‖dx‖ + ε_0$,
 \item $‖x^j‖ ≤ ε_j$ if $j > 0$, for some positive $ε_j$ to be chosen later. This implies $‖dx^j‖ ≤ ε_j$
   for all $j > 0$.
\end{itemize}

Using Lemma~\ref{is_weak_bdd_exact_controlled_y}, we get a sequence $y^j$ in $M^{i-1}_c$ such that
  \[
    ‖x^j_{|c} - dy^j‖ ≤  K ‖dx^j‖ + δ_j
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    ‖y^j‖ ≤ K(K + 1)‖x^j‖ + τ_j.
  \]
for positive sequences $δ$ and $τ$ to be chosen later.

Since $M^{i-1}_c$ is complete, the series $\sum y^j$ converges as soon as we can guarantee that
$\sum ‖y^j‖$ converges. Our estimates ensure this convergence as soon as the
sum of the $K(K + 1)ε_j + τ_j$ converges so here we only need $ε$ and $τ$ to be
summable.

We then set $y = ∑ y^j$ and compute:
\begin{align*}
  ‖x_{|c} - dy‖ &= \left\|∑_{j ≥ 0} x^j_{|c} - dy^j\right\| \\
    &≤ ∑_{j ≥ 0} \left\|x^j_{|c} - dy^j\right\| \\
    &≤ ∑_{j ≥ 0} K‖dx^j‖ + δ_j \\
    &≤ K‖dx‖ + Kε_0 + δ_0 +  ∑_{j > 0} (Kε_j + δ_j)
\end{align*}

So everything is fine as long as $∑_{j ≥ 0} (Kε_j + δ_j) ≤ ε$, say $ε_j = ε2^{-j-2}/K$ and $δ_j = ε2^{-j-2}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}

  \lean{system_of_complexes.is_weak_bounded_exact.strong_of_complete}
  \leanok
  \uses{is_weak_bounded_exact, is_bounded_exact, admissible}
  Let $(M^\bullet_c)_{c\geq c_0}$ be an admissible collection
  of complexes of complete normed abelian groups.

  Assume that $M^\bullet_c$ is weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$.
  Then $M^\bullet_c$, for every $δ > 0$, it is $\leq k^2$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$
  with bound $K+δ$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \uses{is_bounded_exact_of_weakly}
  Lemma~\ref{is_bounded_exact_of_weakly} ensures we only need to care about cocycles
  of $M$. More precisely, let $x$ be a cocycle in $M^i_{k^2c}$ for some $i ≤ m$ and $c ≥ c_0$.
  We need to find $y \in M^{i-1}_c$ such that $dy = x_{|c}$.

  By weak $\leq k$-exactness applied to $x$ and a sequence $ε_j$ to be chosen later, we can find
  a sequence $w^j \in M^{i-1}_{kc}$ such that
  \[
    ‖x_{kc} - dw^j‖ ≤ ε_j.
  \]
  Then, by weak $\leq k$-exactness applied to each $w^{j + 1} - w^j$ and a sequence $δ_j$ to be chosen later, we can find
  a sequence $z^j \in M^{i-2}_{c}$ such that
  \[
    ‖(w^{j+1} - w^j)_{|c} - dz^j‖ ≤ K‖dw^{j+1} - dw^j‖ + δ_j.
  \]
  We set $y^j := w^j_{|c} - \sum_{l=0}^{j-1} dz^l ∈ M^{i-1}_c$.


  We have
  \begin{align*}
    ‖y^{j + 1} - y^j‖ &=  \left\|(w^{j + 1} - w^j)_{|c} - dz^j\right\| \\
                      &≤  K‖dw^{j+1} - dw^j‖ + δ_j \\
                      &≤  2Kε_j + δ_j.
  \end{align*}
  So $y^j$ is a Cauchy sequence as long as we make sure $2Kε_j + δ_j ≤ 2^{-j}$ for instance.
  Since $M^{i-1}_c$ is complete, this sequence converges to some $y$.
  Because $dy^j = dw^j_{|c}$, we get that $‖x_{|c} - dy^j‖ ≤ ε_j$ and in the limit $x_{|c} = dy$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{weaksnakelemma}
  \leanok
  \lean{weak_normed_snake}
  \uses{is_weak_bounded_exact, admissible}
  Let $(M^\bullet_c)_{c\geq c_0}$ and $(M'^\bullet_c)_{c\geq c_0}$ be two admissible collections
  of complexes of complete normed abelian groups.
  For each $c\geq c_0$ let $f^\bullet_c: M^\bullet_c\to M'^\bullet_c$ be a collection of maps
  between these collections of complexes
  that are norm-nonincreasing and which all commute with all restriction maps,
  and assume that there exists these maps satisfy
  \[
    ‖x_{|c}‖ ≤ K''‖f(x)‖
  \]
  for all $i ≤ m+1$ and all $x\in M^i_{k''c}$.
  Let $N^\bullet_c=M'^\bullet_c/M^\bullet_c$
  be the collection of quotient complexes, with the quotient norm;
  this is again an admissible collection of complexes.

  Assume that $M^\bullet_c$ (resp. $M'^\bullet_c$) is weakly $\leq k$-exact
  (resp. $≤ k'$-exact) in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$
  (resp. $K'$).
  Then $N^\bullet_c$ is weakly $\leq kk'k''$-exact in degrees $\leq m-1$ for $c\geq c_0$
  with bound $K'(KK'' + 1)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\leanok
\def\ndn{\left\|dn\right\|}
Let $n \in N^i_{kk'k''c}$ for $i\leq m-1$.
We fix $ε > 0$. We need to find an element $y \in N^{i-1}_c$ such that
\[
  ‖n_{|c} - dy‖ \leq K'(KK'' + 1)‖dn‖ + \epsilon.
\]

Pick any preimage $m' \in M'^i_{kk'k''c}$ of $n$. In particular $dm'$ is
a preimage of $dn$.
By definition of the quotient norm,
we can find $m_1 ∈ M^{i+1}_{kk'k''c}$ and $m_1'' ∈ (M')^{i+1}_{kk'k''c}$ such that
\[
dm' = f(m_1) + m_1''
\]
with $‖m_1''‖ \leq ‖dn‖ + ε_1$, for some positive $ε_1$ to be chosen later.

Applying the differential to the last displayed equation, and using that this
kills the image of $d$, and that $f$ is a map of complexes, we see that
\[
f(dm_1) = -dm_1''.
\]
Using the norm bound on $f$, we get
\[\begin{aligned}
  ‖dm_{1|kk'c}‖ &≤ K''‖f(dm_1)‖ = K''‖dm_1''‖\\
                &≤ K''‖m_1''‖ ≤ K''‖dn‖ + K''ε_1.
\end{aligned}\]
On the other hand, weak exactness of $M$ applied to $m_{1|kk'c}$
gives $m_0 ∈ M^i_{k'c}$ such that
\[
  ‖m_{1|kk'c|k'c} - dm_0‖ \leq K‖dm_{1|kk'c}‖ + ε_1
\]
which combines with the previous estimate to give:
\[
  ‖m_{1|k'c} - dm_0‖ \leq K K'' \left\|d n\right\| + (KK'' + 1)ε_1.
\]
Now let $m'_{\mathrm{new}} = m'_{|k'c} - f(m_0) \in M'^i_{k'c}$; this is a lift of $n_{|k'c}$.
Then
\[
dm'_{\mathrm{new}} = dm'_{|k'c} - f(m_{1|k'c}) + f(m_{1|k'c} - dm_0) = m''_{1|k'c} + f(m_{1|k'c} - dm_0).
\]
In particular,
\[
‖dm'_{\mathrm{new}}‖ ≤ (KK'' + 1)\ndn + (KK'' + 2) ε_1.
\]
Now weak exactness of $M'$ gives $x \in M'^{i-1}_c$ such that
\[
  ‖m'_{\mathrm{new}|c} - dx‖ ≤ K'‖dm'_\mathrm{new}‖ + ε_1 \leq
    K'((K K'' + 1) \ndn + (KK'' + 2) ε_1) + ε_1.
\]
In particular, letting $y \in N^{i-1}_c$ be the image of $x$, we get
\[
  ‖n_{|c} - dy‖ ≤ K'(K K'' + 1)\ndn + (K'(K  K'' + 2) + 1) ε_1,
\]
which is exactly what we wanted if we choose
$ε_1 = ε/(K'(K  K'' + 2) + 1)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
  \label{snakelemma}
  \uses{is_bounded_exact, admissible}
  Let $(M^\bullet_c)_{c\geq c_0}$ and $(M'^\bullet_c)_{c\geq c_0}$ be two admissible collections
  of complexes of complete normed abelian groups.
  For $c\geq c_0$ let $f^\bullet_c: M^\bullet_c\to M'^\bullet_c$ be a collection of maps
  between these collections of complexes
  that is strictly compatible with the norm and commutes with restriction maps,
  and assume that it satisfies
  \[
    ‖x_{|c}‖ ≤ K''‖f(x)‖
  \]
  for all $i ≤ m+1$ and all $x\in M^i_{k''c}$.
  Let $N^\bullet_c=M'^\bullet_c/\overline{M^\bullet_c}$
  be the collection of quotient complexes, with the quotient norm;
  this is again an admissible collection of complexes.

  Assume that $M^\bullet_c$ (resp. $M'^\bullet_c$) is $\leq k$-exact
  (resp. $≤ k'$-exact) in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$
  (resp. $K'$).
  Then, for every $δ > 0$, $N^\bullet_c$ is $\leq (kk'k'')^2$-exact in
  degrees $\leq m-1$ for $c\geq c_0$
  with bound $K'(KK'' + 1) + δ$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{weaksnakelemma, weakexact_implies_exact}
  The exactness assumptions on $M$ and $M'$ give the corresponding
  weak exactness condition. Hence Proposition~\ref{weaksnakelemma}
  ensures that $N^\bullet_c$ is weakly $\leq kk'k''$-exact in degrees
  $\leq m-1$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K'(KK'' + 1)$.
  Since $N^\bullet_c$ is a complex of complete groups,
  Lemma~\ref{weakexact_implies_exact} gives the required exactness.

  Fix an integer $m\geq 0$ and constants $k$, $K$.
  Then there exists an $\epsilon>0$ and constants $k_0$, $K_0$,
  depending (only) on $k$, $K$ and $m$, with the following property.

  Consider an admissible system of double complexes $M^{p,q}_c$, $p,q\geq 0$, $c\geq c_0$,
  of complete normed abelian groups as well as some $k'\geq k_0$ and some $H>0$, such that

  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item for $i=0,\ldots,m+1$, the rows $M^{i,q}_c$ are weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m-1$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$;
	  \item for $j=0,\ldots,m$, the columns $M^{p,j}_c$ are weakly $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $K$;
  \item for $q=0,\ldots,m$ and $c\geq c_0$, there is a map $h^q_{k'c}: M^{0,q+1}_{k'c}\to M^{1,q}_c$ with
  \[
  ‖h^q_{k'c}(x)‖_{M^{1,q}_c}\leq H‖x‖_{M^{0,q+1}_{k'c}}
  \]
  for all $x\in M^{0,q+1}_c$, and such that for all $c\geq c_0$ and $x\in M^{0,q}_{k'^2c}$, one has
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:homotopicmapsmall}
  ‖\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,k'c}^{1,q}(d^{0,q}(x))\pm h^q_{k'^2c}(d'^{0,q}_{k'^2c}(x))\pm d'^{1,q-1}_{k'c}(h^{q-1}_{k'^2c}(x))‖_{M^{1,q}_{k'c}}\leq \epsilon ‖\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,c}^{0,q}(x)‖_{M^{0,q}_c}.
  \end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
  Then the first row is weakly $\leq k'^2$ exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$ with bound $2K_0H$.
\end{proposition}

We note that the bound on the homotopy is of a peculiar nature, in that the bound only depends on a deep restriction of $x$.

\begin{proof}
  \proves{spectral}
  \uses{weaksnakelemma}
  First, we treat the case $m=0$.
  If $m=0$, we claim that one can take $\epsilon=\tfrac 1{2k}$ and $k_0=k$.
  We have to prove exactness at the first step.
  Let $x_{k'^2c}\in M^{0,0}_{k'^2c}$ and
  denote $x_{k'c}=\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,k'c}^{0,0}(x)$
  and $x_c=\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,c}^{0,0}(x)$.
  Then by assumption (2) (and $k'\geq k$), we have
  \[
  ‖x_c‖_{M^{0,0}_c}\leq k‖d^{0,0}_{k'c}(x_{k'c})‖_{M^{1,0}_{k'c}}.
  \]
  On the other hand, by (3),
  \[
  ‖\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,k'c}^{1,0}(d^{0,0}_{k'^2c}(x))\pm h^0_{k'^2c}(d'^{0,0}_{k'^2c}(x))‖_{M^{1,0}_{k'c}}\leq \epsilon ‖x_c‖_{M^{0,0}_c}.
  \]
  In particular, noting that $\mathrm{res}_{k'^2c,k'c}^{1,0}(d^{0,0}_{k'^2c}(x)) = d^{0,0}_{k'c}(x_{k'c})$, we get
  \[
  ‖x_c‖_{M^{0,0}_c}\leq k‖d^{0,0}_{k'c}(x_{k'c})‖_{M^{1,0}_{k'c}}\leq k\epsilon ‖x_c‖_{M^{0,0}_c} + kH ‖d'^{0,0}_{k'^2c}(x)‖_{M^{0,1}_{k'^2c}}.
  \]
  Thus, taking $\epsilon=\tfrac 1{2k}$ as promised, this implies
  \[
  ‖x_c‖_{M^{0,0}_c}\leq 2kH ‖d'^{0,0}_{k'^2c}(x)‖_{M^{0,1}_{k'^2c}}.
  \]
  This gives the desired $\leq \max(k'^2,2k_0H)$-exactness in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$.

  Now we argue by induction on $m$.
  Consider the complex $N^{p,q}$ given by $M^{p,q+1}$ for $q\geq 1$
  and $N^{p,0} = M^{p,1}/\overline{M^{p,0}}$
  (the quotient by the closure of the image, which is also the completion of $M^{p,1}/M^{p,0}$),
  equipped with the quotient norm.
  Using the normed version of the snake lemma,
  Proposition~\ref{snakelemma} in the appendix to this lecture,
  one checks that this satisfies the assumptions for $m-1$,
  with $k$ replaced by $\max(k^4,k^3+k+1)$.
