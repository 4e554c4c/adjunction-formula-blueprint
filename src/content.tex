\begin{definition}

  Let $r, r' \in \mathbb R_{>0}$,
  and let $V$ be an $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-module.
  Assume $r' \le 1$.
  Let $M$ be a profinitely filtered pseudo-normed group with $r'$-action of $T^{-1}$.
  Let $\text{BD} = (n,f,h)$ be a Breen--Deligne package,
  and let $c' = (c'_0, c'_1, c'_2, \dots)$ be a sequence of constants in $\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$
  that is $\text{BD}$-suitable.

  For every $c \in \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$,
  the maps from Definition~\ref{eval_CLCFPTinv}
  induced by the universal maps $f_i$ from the Breen--Deligne package $(n,f,h)$
  assemble into a complex of normed abelian groups
  \[
    C^{\text{BD}}_{c'}(M)_c^\bullet \colon
    \dots \to
    \hat V(M_{\le c_i}^{n_i})^{T^{-1}}
    \to
    \hat V(M_{\le c_{i+1}}^{n_{i+1}})^{T^{-1}}
    \to \dots \to 0.
  \]
  Together, these complexes fit into a system of complexes
  with the natural restriction maps.
\end{definition}

Now we state the following result, which is our main goal.

\textbf{N.b.:}
It differs from Theorem~9.4 of \cite{Analytic} only in one aspect:
we assume that the sets $S$ are finite, rather than profinite.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{first_target}
  \lean{first_target}
  \leanok
  \uses{BD_system}
  Let $\text{BD} = (n,f,h)$ be a Breen--Deligne package,
  and let $c' = (c'_0, c'_1, c'_2, \dots)$ be a sequence of constants in $\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$
  that is $\text{BD}$-suitable.
	Fix radii $1>r'>r>0$.
  For any $m$ there is some $k$ and $c_0$ such that for all finite sets $S$ and all $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-modules $V$,
  the system of complexes
  \[
    C^{\text{BD}}_{c'}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_c^\bullet \colon
    \widehat{V}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}} \to
    \widehat{V}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)_{\leq c'_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}}
    \to \ldots
  \]
  is $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  \label{boundary-text}
  \textbf{Note: the text below is copied almost verbatim from \cite{Analytic}.
  Small parts have been formalized.
  We expect that the text will be rewritten and expanded as the formalization project progresses.}
\end{remark}

% Let us first check that this implies Theorem~\ref{explicit1}.

% \begin{proof}[Theorem~\ref{first_target} implies Theorem~\ref{explicit1}] By the preceding discussion, one can compute
% \[
% R\Hom_{\mathbb Z[T^{-1}]}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S),\widehat{V})
% \]
% as the derived inverse limit of $C_c^\bullet$ over all $c>0$; equivalently, all $c\geq c_0$. Theorem~\ref{first_target} implies that for any $m\geq 0$ the pro-system of cohomology groups $H^m(C_c^\bullet)$ is pro-zero (as $H^m(C_{kc}^\bullet)\to H^m(C_c^\bullet)$ is zero). Thus, the derived inverse limit vanishes, as desired.
% \end{proof}

% We remark that Theorem~\ref{first_target} reduces formally to the case that $S$ is finite; we make this reduction.

We will prove Theorem~\ref{first_target} by induction on $m$.
Unfortunately, the induction requires us to prove a stronger statement.

Endow $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))$ with the subspaces
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c} = \{f: \Lambda\to \overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)\mid \forall x\in \Lambda, f(x)\in \overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)_{\leq c‖x‖}\}.
\]
As $\Lambda$ is polyhedral, it is enough to check the given condition for finitely many $x$.

% We can then define double complexes like \eqref{eq:doublecomplex}.
% Lemma~\ref{lem:Tinv} stays true with the same constants.
Now we claim the following generalization of Theorem~\ref{first_target}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{explicit}
  \uses{polyhedral_lattice, BD_system}
  Fix radii $1>r'>r>0$. For any $m$ there is some $k$
  such that for all polyhedral lattices $\Lambda$
  there is a constant $c_0(\Lambda)>0$
  such that for all finite sets $S$
  and all $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-modules $V$,
  the system of complexes
  \[
  C_{\Lambda,c}^\bullet \colon
  \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}} \to
  \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}} \to \ldots
  \]
  is $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0(\Lambda)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \proves{first_target}
  \uses{explicit}
  \leanok
  Use $\Lambda = \mathbb Z$, and the isomorphism $\Hom(\mathbb Z, A) \cong A$.
\end{proof}

We note that the constants $c_1,c_2,\ldots$ implicit in the choice of the complex
are chosen once and for all (after fixing $r$ and $r'$),
and it can be ensured that the transition maps in the complex are norm-nonincreasing.
Indeed, if the $c_i$ are suitable as in Definition~\ref{BD_suitable},
the maps
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^{a_i})\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_{i+1}c}^{a_{i+1}})
\]
will have bounded norm, independently of $V$ (as they are a certain universal finite sum of maps induced by maps between the profinite sets in paranthesis, each of which induces a map of norm bounded by $1$), so on the subspace of $T^{-1}$-invariants, one can shrink the norm down to $1$ by shrinking $c_{i+1}$. We make and fix this choice of the $c_i$ for the statement of Theorem~\ref{explicit}, and the rest of the proof.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{explicit}]
  \proves{explicit}
  \uses{spectral,combi,basehomotopy,homotopyNelements,normedcompletion}
  We argue by induction on $m$, so assume the result for $m-1$
  (this is no assumption for $m=0$, so we do not need an induction start).
  This gives us some $k>1$ for which the statement of Theorem~\ref{explicit} holds true for $m-1$;
  if $m=0$, simply take any $k>1$.
  In the proof below, we will increase $k$ further in a way that depends only on $m$ and $r$.
  After this modified choice of $k$, we fix $\epsilon$ and $k_0$ as provided by Proposition~\ref{spectral}.
  Moreover, we let $k'$ be the supremum of $k_0$ and the $c_i'$ from
  Lemma~\ref{basehomotopy} (and~\ref{homotopyNelements}) for $i=0,\ldots,m$.
  Finally, choose a positive integer $b$ so that $2k'(\tfrac r{r'})^b\leq \epsilon$,
  and let $N$ be the minimal power of $2$ that satisfies
\[
k'/N\leq (r')^b.
\]
Then in particular $r^bN\leq \frac 2{k'}(\tfrac{r}{r'})^b\leq \epsilon$.

We consider the diagonal embedding
\[
\Lambda\hookrightarrow \Lambda' = \Lambda^N,
\]
where we endow $\Lambda'$ with the norm
\[
‖(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_N)‖_{\Lambda'} = \tfrac 1N(‖\lambda_1‖_\Lambda+\ldots+‖\lambda_N‖_\Lambda).
\]
For any $m\geq 1$, let $\Lambda'^{(m)}$ be given by $\Lambda'^m / \Lambda\otimes (\mathbb Z^m)_{\sum=0}$; then $\Lambda'^{(\bullet)}$ is cosimplicial polyhedral lattice, the \v{C}ech conerve of $\Lambda\to \Lambda'$. For $m=0$, we set $\Lambda'^{(0)} = \Lambda$. It is clear that all of these are polyhedral lattices.

In particular, for any $c>0$, we have
\[
\Hom(\Lambda'^{(m)},\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c} = \Hom(\Lambda',\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}^{m/\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}},
\]
the $m$-fold fibre product of $\Hom(\Lambda',\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$ over $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$; and
\[
\Hom(\Lambda',\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c} = \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N,
\]
with the map to $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$ given by the sum map.

Consider the collection of double complexes $C_{\Lambda'^{(\bullet)},c}^\bullet$ associated to this cosimplicial polyhedral lattice by Dold-Kan. Up to rescaling the norms in the complex for $\Lambda'^{(m)}$ by a universal constant (something like $(m+2)!$), the differentials are strictly compatible with norms (as they are an alternating sum of $m+1$ face maps, all of which are of norm $\leq 1$), so this collection of normed double complexes is admissible. By induction, the first condition of Proposition~\ref{spectral} is satisfied for all $c\geq c_0$ with $c_0$ large enough (depending on $\Lambda$ but not $V$ or $S$). By Lemma~\ref{combi}, and noting that $\Hom(\Lambda'^{(\bullet)},\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$ is the \v{C}ech nerve of
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N\xrightarrow{\sum} \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c},
\]
also the second condition is satisfied, with $k$ the maximum of the previous $k$ and some constant depending only on $m$ and $r$, provided we take $c_0$ large enough so that $(k-1)r'c_ic_0/N$ is at least the $d$ of Lemma~\ref{combi} for all $i=0,\ldots,m$ (so this choice of $c_0$ again depends on $\Lambda$). Indeed, then one can splice a surjection of profinite sets between the maps
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic/N}^{Na}\to\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^a
\]
and
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq kc_ic/N}^{Na}\to \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq kc_ic}^a,
\]
and so the transition map between the columns of that double complex factors over a similar complex arising from a simplicial hypercover of profinite sets, so the constants are bounded by Proposition~\ref{prop:normedcompletion},
	% Lemma~\ref{lem:Tinv},
	and Proposition~\ref{snakelemma}
	(plus probably some other results of which we need to work out the details).
	At this point, we have finalized our choice of $k$ (and, as promised, this choice depended only on $m$ and $r$), and so we also finalized the constants $\epsilon$, $k'$ and $N$ from the first paragraph of the proof.

Finally, to check the third condition, we use Lemma~\ref{homotopyNelements} to find, in degrees $\leq m$, a homotopy between the two maps from the first row
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}}\to \ldots
\]
to the second row
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N)^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_1c/N}^{2N})^{T^{-1}}\to \ldots
\]
respectively induced by the addition $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N\to \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$ (which is the map that forms part of the double complex), and the map that is the sum of the $N$ maps induced by the $N$ projection maps
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N\to \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}\subset \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}.
\]
By Lemma~\ref{homotopyNelements}, we can find this homotopy between the complex for $k'c$ and the complex for $c$, by our choice of $k'\geq c_i'$ for $i=0,\ldots,m$. As $N$ is fixed, the homotopy is the universal homotopy from Lemma~\ref{homotopyNelements}, and in particular its norm is bounded by some universal constant $H$.

Finally, it remains to establish the estimate (\ref{eq:homotopicmapsmall}) on the homotopic map. We note that this takes $x\in \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'^2c_ic}^{a_i})^{T^{-1}}$ (with $i=q$ in the notation of (\ref{eq:homotopicmapsmall})) to the element
\[
y\in \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'c_ic/N}^{Na_i})^{T^{-1}}
\]
that is the sum of the $N$ pullbacks along the $N$ projection maps $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'c_ic/N}^{Na_i}\to \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'^2c_ic}^{a_i}$. We note that these actually take image in $\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^{a_i}$ as $N\geq k'$, so this actually gives a well-defined map
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^{a_i})^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'c_ic/N}^{Na_i})^{T^{-1}}.
\]
We need to see that this map is of norm $\leq \epsilon$. Now note that by our choice of $N$, we actually have $k'c_ic/N\leq (r')^b c_ic$, so this can be written as the composite of the restriction map
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^{a_i})^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq (r')^b c_ic}^{a_i})^{T^{-1}}
\]
and
\[
\widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq (r')^b c_ic}^{a_i})^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq k'c_ic/N}^{Na_i})^{T^{-1}}.
\]
The first map has norm exactly $r^b$, by $T^{-1}$-invariance, and as multiplication by $T$ scales the norm with a factor of $r$ on $\widehat{V}$.\footnote{Here is where we use $r'>r$, ensuring different scaling behaviour of the norm on source and target.} The second map has norm at most $N$ (as it is a sum of $N$ maps of norm $\leq 1$). Thus, the total map has norm $\leq r^bN$. But by our choice of $N$, we have $r^bN\leq \epsilon$, giving the result.

Thus, we can apply Proposition~\ref{spectral}, and get the desired $\leq \max(k'^2,2k_0H)$-exactness in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$, where $k'$, $k_0$ and $H$ were defined only in terms of $k$, $m$, $r'$ and $r$, while $c_0$ depends on $\Lambda$ (but not on $V$ or $S$). This proves the inductive step.
\end{proof}

\begin{question} Can one make the constants explicit, and how large are they?\footnote{A back of the envelope calculation seems to suggest that $k$ is roughly doubly exponential in $m$, and that $N$ has to be taken of roughly the same magnitude.} Modulo the Breen-Deligne resolution, all the arguments give in principle explicit constants; and actually the proof of the existence of the Breen-Deligne resolution should be explicit enough to ensure the existence of bounds on the $c_i$ and $c_i'$.
\end{question}

This completes the proof of all results announced so far.



\section{Relevant material that should move to a better place}

We often use the following exactness property:

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:completeexact}
Let $M'\xrightarrow{f} M\xrightarrow{g} M''$ be maps of normed abelian groups with $gf=0$ and such that for all $m\in \ker(M\to M'')$ there is some $m'\in M'$ with $f(m')=m$ with $||m'||\leq C||m||$.

Then $\widehat{M'}\xrightarrow{\widehat{f}} \widehat{M}\xrightarrow{\widehat{g}} \widehat{M''}$ satisfy $\widehat{g}\widehat{f}=0$ and for all $m\in \ker(\widehat{M}\to \widehat{M''})$ and all $\epsilon>0$ there is some $m'\in \widehat{M'}$ with $\widehat{f}(\widehat{m'})=\widehat{m}$ and $||m'||\leq (C+\epsilon)||m||$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} One can write any element $m\in \widehat{M}$ as a sum $m_0+m_1+\ldots$ with $m_i\in M$ and $||m_i||\leq \epsilon_i$ for $i>0$ for any given sequence of positive numbers $\epsilon_1\geq \epsilon_2\geq \ldots$. Indeed, we can inductively choose the $m_i$ so that $||m-m_0-\ldots-m_i||\leq \tfrac 12 \epsilon_{i+1}$, in which case $||m_i||\leq \tfrac 12(\epsilon_i+\epsilon_{i+1})\leq \epsilon_i$. Taking the sequence of $\epsilon_i$'s sufficiently small so that $\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i\leq \tfrac {||m||}{2C} \epsilon$, we can lift all $m_i$ to $m_i'$ with $||m_i'||\leq C||m_i||$, and then $m'=m_0'+m_1'+\ldots$ satisfies
\[
||m'||\leq ||m_0'||+C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i\leq C||m_0||+C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i\leq C||m||+2C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i\leq (C+\epsilon)||m||.
\]
\end{proof}

We note that implicit here is that this actually is a condensed abelian group.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:normedcompletion}
  \uses{Vhat}
The condensed abelian group $\widehat{M}$ is canonically identified with the condensed abelian group associated to the topological abelian group $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ given by the completion of $M$ equipped with the topology induced by the norm. The norm defines a natural map of condensed sets
\[
||\cdot||: \widehat{M}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}.
\]

Moreover, for any hypercover $S_\bullet\to S$ of a profinite set $S$ by profinite sets $S_i$, the complex
\[
0\to \widehat{M}(S)\to \widehat{M}(S_0)\to \widehat{M}(S_1)\to \ldots
\]
is exact, and whenever $f\in \ker(\widehat{M}(S_m)\to \widehat{M}(S_{m+1}))$ with $||f||\leq c$, then for any $\epsilon>0$ there is some $g\in \widehat{M}(S_{m-1})$ with $||g||\leq (1+\epsilon)c$ such that $d(g)=f$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{prop:completeexact}
For the final assertion, follow the proof of \cite[Theorem 3.3]{Condensed}: When $S$ and all $S_i$ are finite, the hypercover splits, so a contracting homotopy gives the result with constant $1$. In general, write the hypercover as a cofiltered limit of hypercovers of finite sets by finite sets, pass to the filtered colimit, and complete, using Proposition~\ref{prop:completeexact}.

For the identification with the condensed abelian group associated to the topological abelian group $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$, note that in the supremum norm any continuous function from $S$ to $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ can be approximated by locally constant functions arbitrarily well, and that the space of continuous functions from $S$ to $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ is complete with respect to the supremum norm. That $||\cdot||$ defines a map of condensed sets $\widehat{M}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ follows for example from this identification with $\underline{\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}}$, as the norm is by definition a continuous map $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$.
\end{proof}
