\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

The goal of this document is to provide a detailed account
of the proof of the following theorem,
along side a computer verification in the Lean theorem prover
(see \cref{on-lean}).

\begin{theorem}[Clausen--Scholze]
  \label{main-goal}
  Let $0 < p' < p \le 1$ be real numbers,
  let $S$ be a profinite set,
  and let $V$ be a $p$-Banach space.
  Let $\mathcal M_{p'}(S)$ be the space of $p'$-measures on $S$.
  Then
  \[
    \Ext^i_{\Cond(\Ab)}(\mathcal M_{p'}(S), V)=0
  \]
  for $i \ge 1$.
\end{theorem}

We will this statement in more detail in \cref{on-the-statement}.

\begin{remark}
  Status report of the project as of 10-06-2021.
  The main ingredient in the proof of \cref{main-goal}
  is the highly technical \cref{first_target}.

  We have completed a computer verification of this first target in Lean,
  and this document contains an account of the proof.
  We are in the process of cleaning up and documenting this first step.

  Once that is done, we will work on the second step:
  deducing \cref{main-goal} from \cref{first_target}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{On the Lean theorem prover and computer verification of proofs}
\label{on-lean}

The Lean theorem prover is developed by Leonardo de Moura
at Microsoft Research.

TODO: write a short paragraph about what computer verification means,
add pointers to further tutorials/material
