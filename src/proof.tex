\section{End of proof}

Now we state the following result, which is our main goal.

\textbf{N.b.:}
It differs from Theorem~9.4 of \cite{Analytic} only in one aspect:
we assume that the sets $S$ are finite, rather than profinite.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{first_target}
  \lean{first_target}
  \leanok
  \uses{BD_system}
  Let $\BD = (n,f,h)$ be a Breen--Deligne package,
  and let $kappa = (kappa_0, kappa_1, kappa_2, \dots)$ be a sequence of constants in $\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$
  that is $\BD$-suitable.
	Fix radii $1>r'>r>0$.
  For any $m$ there is some $k$ and $c_0$ such that for all finite sets $S$ and all $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-modules $V$,
  the system of complexes
  \[
    C^{\BD}_{kappa}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_c^\bullet \colon
    \widehat{V}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}} \to
    \widehat{V}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)_{\leq kappa_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}}
    \to \ldots
  \]
  is $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$.
\end{theorem}

We will prove Theorem~\ref{first_target} by induction on $m$.
Unfortunately, the induction requires us to prove a stronger statement.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{explicit}
  \uses{Hom, BD_system}
  \leanok
  Fix radii $1>r'>r>0$. For any $m$ there is some $k$
  such that for all polyhedral lattices $\Lambda$
  there is a constant $c_0(\Lambda)>0$
  such that for all finite sets $S$
  and all $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-modules $V$,
  the system of complexes
  \[
  C_{\Lambda,c}^\bullet \colon
  \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}} \to
  \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq \kappa_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}} \to \ldots
  \]
  is $\leq k$-exact in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0(\Lambda)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \proves{first_target}
  \uses{explicit}
  \leanok
  Use $\Lambda = \mathbb Z$, and the isomorphism $\Hom(\mathbb Z, A) \cong A$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{A word on universal constants}:
We fix once and for all, the constants $0 < r < r' \le 1$
a Breen--Deligne package $\BD$,
and a sequence of positive constants $\kappa$ that is very suitable for $(\BD, r, r')$.
Once the full proof is formalized,
we can come back to this place and write a bit more about the other constants.

\textbf{The global strategy}
of the proof is to construct a system of double complexes
such that its first row is the system $C_{\Lambda, \bullet}^\bullet$
occuring in Theorem~\ref{explicit}.
We can then verify the conditions to Proposition~\ref{spectral}
and conclude from there.
For the time being, we will let $M$ denote
an arbitrary profinitely filtered pseudo-normed group with action of $T^{-1}$,
and whenever needed we can specialize to $M = \overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S)$.

\textbf{Further choices of constants}:
We will argue by induction on $m$, so assume the result for $m-1$
(this is no assumption for $m=0$, so we do not need an induction start).
This gives us some $k>1$ for which the statement of Theorem~\ref{explicit} holds true for $m-1$;
if $m=0$, simply take any $k>1$.
In the proof below, we will increase $k$ further in a way that depends only on $m$ and $r$.
After this modified choice of $k$, we fix $\epsilon$ and $k_0$ as provided by Proposition~\ref{spectral}.
Fix a sequence $(\kappa'_i)_i$ of nonnegative reals that is adept to $(\BD, \kappa)$.
(Such a sequence exists by Lemma~\ref{exists_adept}.)
Moreover, we let $k'$ be the supremum of $k_0$ and the $c_i'$ for $i=0,\ldots,m+1$.
Finally, choose a positive integer $b$ so that $2k'(\tfrac r{r'})^b\leq \epsilon$,
and let $N$ be the minimal power of $2$ that satisfies
\[
  k'/N\leq (r')^b.
\]
Then in particular $r^bN\leq 2k'(\tfrac{r}{r'})^b\leq \epsilon$.

\begin{definition}
  \label{double_complex}
  \lean{thm95.double_complex}
  \uses{Hom, cosimplicial-lattice, BD_system}
  \leanok
  Let $\Lambda^{(\bullet)}$ be the cosimplicial polyhedral lattice of
  Definition~\ref{cosimplicial-lattice},
  and recall from \ref{Hom} that $\Hom(\Lambda^{(m)}, M)$ is a
  profinitely filtered pseudo-normed group with action of $T^{-1}$.

  Hence $\Hom(\Lambda^{(\bullet)}, M)$ is a simplicial
  profinitely filtered pseudo-normed group with action of $T^{-1}$.
  
  Now apply the construction of the system of complexes from
  Definition~\ref{BD_system} to obtain a cosimplicial system of complexes
  \[
    C^{\BD}_{\kappa}(\Hom(\Lambda^{(\bullet)}, M))_\bullet^\bullet.
  \]
  Now take the alternating face map cochain complex
  to obtain a system of double complexes, whose objects are
  \[
    \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda^{(m)},M)_{\leq \kappa_ic}^{n_i})^{T^{-1}}.
  \]
  As final step, rescale the norm on the object in row $m$ by $m!$,
  so that all columns become admissible:
  the vertical differential from row $m$ to row $m+1$
  is an alternating sum of $m+1$ maps that are all norm-nonincreasing.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{canonical_iso_1}
  \uses{double_complex}
  \lean{PolyhedralLattice.Hom_cosimplicial_zero_iso}
  \leanok
  In particular, for any $c>0$, we have
  \[
    \Hom(\Lambda',M)_{\leq c} = \Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c/N}^N,
  \]
  with the map to $\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c}$ given by the sum map.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  Omitted (but done in Lean).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{canonical_iso_2}
  \uses{double_complex}
  Similarly, for any $c>0$, we have
  \[
    \Hom(\Lambda'^{(m)},M)_{\leq c} =
    \Hom(\Lambda',M)_{\leq c}^{m/\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c}},
  \]
  the $m$-fold fibre product of $\Hom(\Lambda',M)_{\leq c}$
  over $\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{row_one_iso}
  \uses{canonical_iso_1}
  \lean{thm95.mul_rescale_iso_row_one}
  \leanok
  There is a canonical isomorphism between the first row of the double complex
  \[
    C^{\BD}_{\kappa}(\Hom(\Lambda^{(1)}, M))^\bullet
  \]
  and
  \[
    C^{N \otimes \BD}_{\kappa/N}(\Hom(\Lambda, M))^\bullet
  \]
  which identifies the map induced by
  the diagonal embedding $\Lambda \to \Lambda' = \Lambda^{(1)}$
  with the map induced by $\sigma^N \colon N \otimes \BD \to \BD$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  Omitted (but done in Lean).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{double-complex-htpy}
  \lean{NSC_htpy}
  \uses{double_complex, BD_h_mul_suitable, universal_map_bound_by}
  \leanok
  Let $h$ be the homotopy packaged with $\BD$,
  and let $h^N$ denote the $n$-th iterated composition of $h$
  (see Def~\ref{BD_h_mul})
  which is a homotopy between
  $\pi^N$ and $\sigma^N \colon N \otimes \BD \to \BD$.

  Let $H \in \R_{\ge 0}$ be such that for $i = 0, \dots, m$
  the universal map $h^N_i$ is bound by $H$
  (see Def~\ref{universal_map_bound_by}).

  Then the double complex satisfies
  the normed homotopy homotopy condition (Def~\ref{spectral-htpy})
  for $m$, $H$, and $c_0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{row_one_iso} we may replace the first row by
  \[
    C^{N \otimes \BD}_{\kappa/N}(\Hom(\Lambda, M))^\bullet.
  \]
  Now it is important to recall that we have chosen $k' \ge \kappa'_i$ for all $i = 0, \dots, m+1$.

  Our goal is to find,
  in degrees $\leq m$, a homotopy between the two maps from the first row
  \[
    \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c})^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq \kappa_1c}^2)^{T^{-1}}\to \ldots
  \]
  to the second row
  \[
    \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq c/N}^N)^{T^{-1}}\to \widehat{V}(\Hom(\Lambda,M)_{\leq \kappa_1c/N}^{2N})^{T^{-1}}\to \ldots
  \]
  respectively induced by $\sigma^N$ and $\pi^N$ (which are maps $N \otimes \BD$

  By Definition~\ref{BD_h_mul} and Lemma~\ref{BD_h_mul_suitable}
  we can find this homotopy between the complex for $k'c$ and the complex for~$c$.
  (Here we use $k'\geq c_i'$ for $i=0,\ldots,m$.)
  By assumption, the norm of these maps is bounded by~$H$.

  TODO: To be continued.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \label{boundary-text}
  \textbf{Note: the text below is copied almost verbatim from \cite{Analytic}.
  Small parts have been formalized.
  We expect that the text will be rewritten and expanded as the formalization project progresses.}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{explicit}]
  \proves{explicit}
  \uses{spectral,combi,exists_adept,hypercover-exact,
	cosimplicial-lattice,lem:Tinv, BD_h_mul_suitable}

By induction, the first condition of Proposition~\ref{spectral} is satisfied for all $c\geq c_0$ with $c_0$ large enough (depending on $\Lambda$ but not $V$ or $S$). By Lemma~\ref{combi}, and noting that $\Hom(\Lambda'^{(\bullet)},\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c}$ is the \v{C}ech nerve of
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c/N}^N\xrightarrow{\sum} \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c},
\]
also the second condition is satisfied, with $k$ the maximum of the previous $k$ and some constant depending only on $m$ and $r$, provided we take $c_0$ large enough so that $(k-1)r'c_ic_0/N$ is at least the $d$ of Lemma~\ref{combi} for all $i=0,\ldots,m$ (so this choice of $c_0$ again depends on $\Lambda$). Indeed, then one can splice a surjection of profinite sets between the maps
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic/N}^{Na}\to\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq c_ic}^a
\]
and
\[
\Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq kc_ic/N}^{Na}\to \Hom(\Lambda,\overline{\mathcal M}_{r'}(S))_{\leq kc_ic}^a,
\]
and so the transition map between the columns of that double complex factors over a similar complex arising from a simplicial hypercover of profinite sets, so the constants are bounded by Proposition~\ref{hypercover-exact},
	Lemma~\ref{lem:Tinv},
	and Proposition~\ref{snakelemma}
	(plus probably some other results of which we need to work out the details).
	At this point, we have finalized our choice of $k$ (and, as promised, this choice depended only on $m$ and $r$), and so we also finalized the constants $\epsilon$, $k'$ and $N$ from the first paragraph of the proof.

Finally, to the third condition, has been checked in Proposition~\ref{double-complex-htpy}.

Thus, we can apply Proposition~\ref{spectral}, and get the desired $\leq \max(k'^2,2k_0H)$-exactness in degrees $\leq m$ for $c\geq c_0$, where $k'$, $k_0$ and $H$ were defined only in terms of $k$, $m$, $r'$ and $r$, while $c_0$ depends on $\Lambda$ (but not on $V$ or $S$). This proves the inductive step.
\end{proof}

\begin{question} Can one make the constants explicit, and how large are they?\footnote{A back of the envelope calculation seems to suggest that $k$ is roughly doubly exponential in $m$, and that $N$ has to be taken of roughly the same magnitude.} Modulo the Breen-Deligne resolution, all the arguments give in principle explicit constants; and actually the proof of the existence of the Breen-Deligne resolution should be explicit enough to ensure the existence of bounds on the $c_i$ and $c_i'$.
\end{question}

This completes the proof of all results announced so far.

\section{Relevant material that should move to a better place}

We often use the following exactness property:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:completeexact}
Let $M_0\xrightarrow{d_0} M_1\xrightarrow{d_1} M_2\xrightarrow{d_2} M_3$ be a
four-term complex of bounded maps of normed abelian groups. Assume that, for
some positive constants $C$ and $D$, for all $y\in \ker(d_1: M_1\to M_2)$ there
is some $x\in M_0$ with $d_0(x)=y$ and $‖x‖\leq C‖y‖$, and similarly for all
$z\in \ker(d_2: M_2\to M_3)$, there is some $y\in M_1$ with $d_1(y)=z$ and
$‖y‖\leq D‖z‖$.

Then
$\widehat{M}_0\xrightarrow{\widehat{d}_0} \widehat{M}_1\xrightarrow{\widehat{d}_1} \widehat{M}_2\xrightarrow{\widehat{d}_2} \widehat{M}_3$
is a complex, and for all $\widehat{y}\in \widehat{M}_1$ and all $\epsilon>0$
there is some $\widehat{x}\in \widehat{M}_0$ with
$\widehat{d}_1(\widehat{x})=\widehat{y}$ and
$‖\widehat{x}‖\leq (C+\epsilon)‖\widehat{y}‖$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First, we claim that $\ker(d_1: M_1\to M_2)$ is dense in
$\ker(\widehat{d}_1: \widehat{M}_1\to \widehat{M}_2)$. Pick any $\delta>0$ and
take $y\in M_1$ such that $‖\widehat{y}-y‖\leq \delta$. Let $z=d_1(y)\in M_2$,
which has norm $‖z‖=‖d_1(y)‖=‖d_1(y-\widehat{y})‖$ bounded by
$C_{d_1}\delta$, where $C_{d_1}$ is the norm of $d_1$. We can thus find some
$y'\in M_1$ with $‖y'‖\leq DC_{d_1}\delta$ and $d_1(y')=z$. Replacing $y$ by
$y-y'$, we can thus find $y\in \ker(d_1: M_1\to M_2)$ such that still
$‖\widehat{y}-y‖\leq (1+DC_{d_1})\delta$; as $\delta$ was arbitrary, this
gives the desired density.

This implies that one can write $\widehat{y}$ as a sum $y_0+y_1+\ldots$ with
$y_i\in \ker(d_1)$ and $‖y_i‖\leq \epsilon_i$ for $i>0$ for any given sequence
of positive numbers $\epsilon_1\geq \epsilon_2\geq \ldots$. Indeed, we can
inductively choose the $y_i$ so that
$‖\widehat{y}-y_0-\ldots-y_i‖\leq \tfrac 12 \epsilon_{i+1}$, in which case
$‖y_i‖\leq \tfrac 12(\epsilon_i+\epsilon_{i+1})\leq \epsilon_i$. Taking the
sequence of $\epsilon_i$'s sufficiently small so that
$\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i\leq \tfrac {‖\widehat{y}‖}{2C} \epsilon$, we can lift
all $y_i$ to $x_i$ with $‖x_i‖\leq C‖y_i‖$, and then
$\widehat{x}=x_0+x_1+\ldots$ maps to $\widehat{y}$ and satisfies
\[
  ‖\widehat{x}‖\leq ‖x_0‖+C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i
  \leq C‖y_0‖+C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i
  \leq C‖\widehat{y}‖+2C\sum_{i>0} \epsilon_i
  \leq (C+\epsilon)‖\widehat{y}‖.\qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

See Definition~\ref{CLC} for the definition of $\widehat{M}$.

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:normedcompletion}
  \uses{CLC}
The condensed abelian group $\widehat{M}$ is canonically identified with the condensed abelian group associated to the topological abelian group $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ given by the completion of $M$ equipped with the topology induced by the norm. The norm defines a natural map of condensed sets
\[
‖\cdot‖: \widehat{M}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}.
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Note that in the supremum norm any continuous function from $S$ to $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ can be approximated by locally constant functions arbitrarily well, and that the space of continuous functions from $S$ to $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}$ is complete with respect to the supremum norm. That $‖\cdot‖$ defines a map of condensed sets $\widehat{M}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ follows for example from this identification with $\underline{\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}}$, as the norm is by definition a continuous map $\widehat{M}_{\mathrm{top}}\to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{hypercover-exact}
  \uses{CLC}
For any hypercover $S_\bullet\to S$ of a profinite set $S$ by profinite sets $S_i$, the complex
\[
0\to \widehat{M}(S)\to \widehat{M}(S_0)\to \widehat{M}(S_1)\to \ldots
\]
is exact, and whenever $f\in \ker(\widehat{M}(S_m)\to \widehat{M}(S_{m+1}))$ with $‖f‖\leq c$, then for any $\epsilon>0$ there is some $g\in \widehat{M}(S_{m-1})$ with $‖g‖\leq (1+\epsilon)c$ such that $d(g)=f$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \uses{prop:completeexact}
Follow the proof of \cite[Theorem 3.3]{Condensed}: When $S$ and all $S_i$ are finite, the hypercover splits, so a contracting homotopy gives the result with constant $1$. In general, write the hypercover as a cofiltered limit of hypercovers of finite sets by finite sets, pass to the filtered colimit, and complete, using Proposition~\ref{prop:completeexact}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:Tinv}
  \uses{profinitely_filtered_pseudo_normed_group_with_Tinv,CLC,normed_with_aut}
  Let $M$ be a profinitely filtered pseudo-normed group with action of $T^{-1}$.
  For any $r$-normed $\mathbb Z[T^{\pm 1}]$-module $V$, any $c>0$ and any $a$, the map
\[
\widehat{V}(M_{\leq c}^a)\xrightarrow{T^{-1}-[T^{-1}]^\ast} \widehat{V}(M_{\leq r'c}^a)
\]
is surjective, has norm bounded by $r^{-1}+1$, and for any $f\in \widehat{V}(M_{\leq r'c}^a)$ and $\epsilon>0$ there is some $g\in \widehat{V}(M_{\leq c}^a)$ with $f(x)=T^{-1}g(x)-g(T^{-1}x)$ and $‖g‖\leq \frac{r}{1-r}(1+\epsilon) ‖f‖$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Given $f: M_{\leq r'c}^a\to \widehat{V}$, choose an extension to a map $\tilde{f}: M^a\to \widehat{V}$ with $‖\tilde{f}‖\leq (1+\epsilon)‖f‖$. Such an extension exists: By induction (and using a sequence of $\epsilon_n$'s with $\prod_n (1+\epsilon_n)\leq 1+\epsilon$), it suffices to see that for any closed immersion $A\subset B$ of profinite sets and a map $f_A: A\to \widehat{V}$, there is an extension $f_B: B\to \widehat{V}$ of $f_A$ with $‖f_B‖\leq (1+\epsilon)‖f_A‖$. To see this, write $f_A$ as a (fast) convergent sum of maps that factor over a finite quotient of $A$; for maps factoring over a finite quotient of $A$, the extension is clear (and can be done in a norm-preserving way), as any map from $A$ to a finite set can be extended to a map from $B$ to the same finite set.

Given $\tilde{f}$, we can now define $g: M_{\leq c}^a$ by
\[
g(x) = T\tilde{f}(x)+T^2\tilde{f}(T^{-1}x)+\ldots+T^{n+1}\tilde{f}(T^{-n}x)+\ldots\in \widehat{V};
\]
then $‖g‖\leq \frac r{1-r}‖\tilde{f}‖\leq \frac r{1-r}(1+\epsilon)‖f‖$.
\end{proof}
